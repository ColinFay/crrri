# crrri

The goal of crrri is to provide a native Chrome Remote Interface in R using the Chrome DevTools Protocol.  
This is a low-level implementation of the protocol. Deprecated commands are not included.  

Even if he DevTools protocol is not user-friendly, **with this package, you can easily interact with a headless Chrome using R**. The only system requirement is to have a recent version of Chromium or Chrome (a standalone version works perfectly well).
This package is mainly intended for developers and provides no helpers for current tasks, like taking a screenshot or scraping web pages.  
This is your responsibility to correctly use this package: interacting with a browser is not straightforward.

## Installation

You can install the development version of crrri from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github('rlesur/crrri')
```

## Example

``` r
library(crrri)
library(promises)
library(jsonlite)

# Ensure that google-chrome is in your PATH, otherwise use the bin argument
chrome <- chr_connect()
```

``` r
## Chrome succesfully launched in headless mode 
## R succesfully connected to headless Chrome through DevTools Protocol.
```

Since all the operations that we can do with the DevTools Protocol are asynchronous, all the functions return Promises (in the sense of the promises package). For instance:

```r
chrome
```

```r
## <Promise [fulfilled: list]>
```

Chrome DevTools commands are built on top of the `promises::then()` function. So, you can use the single magrittr pipe operator `%>%` to chain operations:

``` r
r_project <- 
  chrome %>% 
  Page.enable() %>%
  Page.navigate(url = "https://www.r-project.org/")

# event listeners have to be developed
# For now, you have to wait that the frame is loaded
```

The value of the fulfilled promise is a list of 2 objects:

- `cnx`: information about the connexion. It is used internally, so do not use it.
- `result`: a list composed of the objects received from Chrome.

For instance, if you want to print a PDF of the R Project website:

```r
r_project %>%
  Page.printToPDF() %...>% {
    .$result$data %>% base64_dec() %>% writeBin("r-project.pdf")
  } %...!% {
    cat(c("An error has occured:", as.character(.)), sep = "\n")
  } %>%
  finally(~ chr_disconnect(chrome))
```
